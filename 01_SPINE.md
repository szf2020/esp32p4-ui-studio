# Heading Font Pipeline Fix

# Heading Font Pipeline Validation

## Status

```text
PROVEN ON PHYSICAL ESP32-P4
```

---

## Original Blocker

```text
Heading export used:

lv_font_montserrat_32

Browser Preview rendered correctly.

Generated LVGL export rendered correctly.

Physical ESP32-P4 could not safely validate the Heading widget because the required LVGL font sizes were not enabled in the active ESP-IDF configuration.
```

---

## Root Cause

```text
ForgeUI Studio export and runtime were aligned.

LVGL font resources were not.

The generated export referenced font sizes that were unavailable in the active firmware build.
```

---

## Fix Applied

Enabled larger Montserrat font sizes in:

```text
firmware/ForgeUI-One/sdkconfig

firmware/ForgeUI-One/sdkconfig.defaults
```

Required font configuration:

```text
CONFIG_LV_FONT_MONTSERRAT_28=y
CONFIG_LV_FONT_MONTSERRAT_30=y
CONFIG_LV_FONT_MONTSERRAT_32=y
CONFIG_LV_FONT_MONTSERRAT_36=y
CONFIG_LV_FONT_MONTSERRAT_40=y
CONFIG_LV_FONT_MONTSERRAT_48=y
```

    ↓

    ↓

```

---

## Result

```text
Heading rendered successfully on physical ESP32-P4.
```

Proven:

```text
Heading Widget
    ✓ Proven

LVGL Font Pipeline
    ✓ Proven

Builder → Preview → Export → P4
    ✓ Proven
```

---

## Architecture Truth

```text
Widgets may reference LVGL fonts.

Firmware must provide matching LVGL font resources.

Preview and Export are only considered proven once validated on physical hardware.
```

---

## Future Benefit

The following font sizes are now available to future widgets:

```text
28
30
32
36
40
48
```

This supports:

```text
Heading Widget

Clock Widget

WiFi Widget

Future Dashboard Widgets

Future Status Widgets
```

without requiring further LVGL font configuration work.

```
```

---

# Heading Architecture Truth

```text
Browser font-size and LVGL font size are not pixel-identical.

CSS font-size: 32px
    is not visually identical to
lv_font_montserrat_32

This is acceptable.

The important proof is that the Heading widget exports, compiles, flashes, and renders correctly on hardware.

# SEO / Public Project Description

```text
ForgeUI Studio is an open-source visual LVGL v9 HMI designer, code generator, asset pipeline, theme manager, and ESP-IDF flash workflow for ESP32-P4 displays.

It bridges browser-based drag-and-drop UI design with embedded LVGL C export and physical ESP32-P4 hardware validation.

The project targets Waveshare ESP32-P4 7-inch 1024x600 HMI hardware and supports visual layout, preview, generated firmware, uploaded image conversion, theme export, and one-click build/flash workflows.

# WiFi Runtime Binding V2

## Current Mission

```text
FORGEUI_SIDEBAR_AUDIT_CONTINUE
```

## Goal

Keep ForgeUI Studio focused on embedded LVGL / HMI value.

Remove, hide, or park widgets inherited from OpenChakra that do not provide useful embedded ESP32-P4 value.

---

# Sidebar Audit Rule

Each widget should become one of:

```text
KEEP
    Useful embedded LVGL/HMI widget

ALIVE
    Browser Preview + LVGL Export + P4 proof exists

PARK
    Potential future value but not needed now

REMOVE / HIDE
    Web-only clutter or duplicate of a better LVGL widget
```

---

# Current Keep List

```text
Button
Text
Heading
Input
Textarea
Switch
Checkbox
Radio
Slider
Progress
CircularProgress
NumberInput
Select
Image
Box

Led
Bar
Arc
Chart
Table
Calendar
Scale
Roller
Msgbox
ButtonMatrix
Canvas
Line
Tabview
Tileview
```

---

# Current Audit Targets

```text
Icon
IconButton
Divider
```

Likely outcome:

```text
Icon       → Park or map to Image
IconButton → Park or map to Button + Image
Divider    → Park or map to Line
```

Reason:

```text
These are inherited OpenChakra-style web widgets.

They may be redundant because ForgeUI already has Image, Button, and Line widgets with better embedded LVGL value.
```

---

# Next Work Order

```text
1. Audit Icon

2. Audit IconButton

3. Audit Divider

4. Decide KEEP / PARK / REMOVE

5. Update forgeuiCoreWidgets

6. Validate sidebar remains clean

7. Validate Builder drag/drop

8. Validate Browser Preview

9. Validate LVGL Export if kept

10. Validate ESP32-P4 only for widgets that remain embedded-useful
```

---

# Do Not Drift Rules

```text
Do not re-open solved image conversion research.

Do not create a second theme source.

Do not create a second theme selector.

Do not split Preview from Export theme ownership.

Do not add widgets only because OpenChakra had them.

Do not keep web-only widgets unless they have real embedded HMI value.

Do not ask for large file dumps first.

Identify the lane first:
Browser / Export / Firmware / Asset / Theme.
Then request the smallest required file.
```

---

# Current Immediate Next Mission

```text

```

## Start Here

```text
Icon
    ↓
IconButton
    ↓
Divider
```

Decision target:

```text
Park or remove if redundant.

Only keep if they produce useful LVGL output on ESP32-P4.
```

# Save Point Summary

```text
FORGEUI_HEADING_WIDGET_COMPLETE__PREVIEW_EXPORT_P4_FONT_PIPELINE_PROVEN__NEXT_SIDEBAR_AUDIT__2026-06-19
```

## Meaning

```text
Heading widget is complete.

Preview/export/font/hardware path is proven.

Montserrat larger font pipeline is now enabled.

Physical ESP32-P4 renders Heading correctly.

ForgeUI continues with sidebar audit next.

No architecture drift allowed.
