# Theme Drift Elimination (2026-06-13)

## Status

PROVEN

---

## Root Cause

ForgeUI contained two separate theme systems:

### Browser Theme System

```text
FG_PREVIEW_PALETTES
```

Used by:

```text
Theme Manager
ForgeThemeContext
Builder
Browser Preview
```

### Export Theme System

```text
FG_PALETTES
```

Used by:

```text
ForgeUILvglExport.ts
Generated LVGL Code
ESP32-P4
```

The systems drifted apart.

Example:

```text
Nordic Ice rendered correctly in Browser Preview
Nordic Ice exported as Reactor Dark
ESP32-P4 flashed incorrect dark background
```

---

## Architecture Change

Removed:

```text
FG_PALETTES
```

Removed all duplicate palette definitions from:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
```

Export now imports:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/preview/forgeThemeMap.ts
```

and consumes:

```text
FG_PREVIEW_PALETTES
```

directly.

---

## Current Theme Architecture

```text

        ↓

Single source of truth.

## Validation

Nordic Ice

```text
Preview = Correct
ESP32-P4 = Correct
```

Graphite

```text
Preview = Correct
ESP32-P4 = Correct
Carbon texture exported correctly
```

Test Purple

```text
Added to FG_PREVIEW_PALETTES only

Automatically appeared in Theme Manager
Automatically appeared in Browser Preview
Automatically exported through LVGL
Automatically flashed on ESP32-P4
```

Result:

```text
Theme drift eliminated.
Single-source theme architecture proven.
```
---

# Current Architecture Truth

```text
The image conversion problem is solved.

The image integration problem is solved.

The uploaded image pipeline is complete.

The theme selection problem is solved.

The theme ownership problem is solved.

Theme Manager is now the single source of truth for theme selection.

Uploaded image assets now complete a full end-to-end path from ForgeUI Studio to physical ESP32-P4 hardware.

Theme selection now completes a full end-to-end path from ForgeUI Studio to physical ESP32-P4 hardware.

Remaining work is refinement, presentation quality, texture systems, scaling controls, asset management improvements, and multi-image validation.

# ForgeUI Feature Map — Where Things Live

This section exists so future chats do not need 10 file tabs pasted every time.

---

## Main Lanes

```text
Browser / Editor Lane
    ↓
Studio UI, Builder, Theme Manager, Asset Manager, Preview
```

Lives mostly in:

```text
studio/src/components/
studio/src/forgeui/
studio/src/forgeui/preview/
studio/src/forgeui/theme/
```

---

```text
Export Lane
    ↓
Turns Studio layout into LVGL C
```

Main file:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
```

If something works in browser but not on the ESP32-P4, check this lane first.

---

```text
Firmware Lane
    ↓
ESP-IDF / LVGL project that builds and flashes
```

Lives in:

```text
firmware/ForgeUI-One/
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/assets/
```

If the build fails or an asset does not compile, check this lane.

# Feature Touch Map

## Add / edit themes

Touch:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/preview/forgeThemeMap.ts
```

Do not start by touching firmware.

---

## Add background textures

Touch:

```text
studio/public/textures/
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/assets/themes/
studio/src/forgeui/preview/forgeThemeMap.ts
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
```

Known proven example:

```text
carbon_fiber.png
fg_theme_carbon_fiber.c
fg_theme_carbon_fiber
```

---

## Add Background Selector / Randomiser

Likely touch:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/theme/ForgeThemeContext.tsx
Theme Manager component
studio/src/forgeui/preview/forgeThemeMap.ts
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
```

Rule:

```text
Theme Manager owns the UI.
ForgeThemeContext owns selected state.
forgeThemeMap owns preview theme/background metadata.
ForgeUILvglExport owns physical ESP32-P4 output.
```

Do not create another theme selector.

---

## Add uploaded image features

Touch:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/assets/ForgeUIAssetManager.tsx
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUIUploadedAssetRegistry.ts
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
tools/lvgl/LVGLImage.py
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/assets/uploads/
```

---

## Add new widgets

Touch:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUIWidgetSet.ts
studio/src/components/editor/ComponentPreview.tsx
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
```

Rule:

```text
Browser widget first.
LVGL export second.
P4 flash third.
```

---

# Current Texture System Direction

Do not re-research image conversion.

Current next work:

```text
Texture Pack V1
Background Playground
Background Selector
Randomiser
Flash Flair
```

Preferred order:

```text
1. Add more built-in texture PNGs
2. Convert them to LVGL C assets
3. Add texture entries to forgeThemeMap.ts
4. Add textureAsset entries to ForgeUILvglExport.ts
5. Validate Browser Preview
6. Clean Build & Flash
7. Validate physical ESP32-P4
8. Then expose selector/randomiser in Theme Manager
```

---

# Rule For Future Chats

Before asking Scott to paste files, first identify the lane:

```text
Browser problem?
Export problem?
Firmware problem?
Asset conversion problem?
```

Then ask only for the smallest file set from that lane.


# Future One-Wrapper Goal

Current setup:

```text
pip install pypng lz4
```

Check pypng
    ↓
Check lz4
    ↓
Install Missing Dependencies
    ↓

HOW TO ADD WIDGETS # ForgeUI Studio — How To Add A New Custom Widget

Status:

```text
PROVEN
```

Validated using:

```text
Led
Bar
Arc
```

Date:

```text
2026-06-14
```

---

# Purpose

This process is used when adding a new ForgeUI widget that is not part of the original OpenChakra component set.

Examples:

```text
Led
Bar
Arc
Meter
Chart
Table
Tabview
WiFiPanel
ClockPanel
```

---

# Architecture Overview

A widget must be registered in multiple locations.

If one step is missed the widget may:

```text
Appear in toolbox but not drag

Drag but not render

Render but crash inspector

Render but fail export

Export but fail LVGL compilation
```

---

# Step 1 — Add Component Type

File:

```text
studio/src/types.d.ts
```

Locate:

```ts
type ComponentType =
```

Add:

```ts
| 'Led'
| 'Bar'
| 'Arc'
```

Example:

```ts
| 'Badge'
| 'Bar'
| 'Box'
```

---

# Step 2 — Add To Toolbox Menu

File:

```text
menuItems.ts
```

Add:

```ts
Led: {},
Bar: {},
Arc: {},
```

Example:

```ts
Progress: {},
Led: {},
Bar: {},
Arc: {},
Spinner: {},
```

---

# Step 3 — Add To Components List

File:

```text
menuItems.ts
```

Locate:

```ts
componentsList
```

Add:

```ts
'Led',
'Bar',
'Arc',
```

---

# Step 4 — Add To Root Components

File:

```text
studio/src/utils/editor.ts
```

Locate:

```ts
export const COMPONENTS
```

Add:

```ts
'Led',
'Bar',
'Arc',
```

Example:

```ts
'Progress',
'Bar',
'Arc',
'Led',
'Radio',
```

Reason:

```text
Widgets may appear in the sidebar but cannot be dropped onto the canvas unless they are registered in COMPONENTS.
```

---

# Step 5 — Prevent Inspector Crash

File:

```text
studio/src/utils/defaultProps.tsx
```

Original:

```ts
const chakraDefaultProps = Chakra[type].defaultProps
```

Replace with:

```ts
const chakraDefaultProps =
  Chakra[type]?.defaultProps || {}
```

Final:

```ts
export const getDefaultFormProps = (
  type: ComponentType
) => {
  const chakraDefaultProps =
    Chakra[type]?.defaultProps || {}

  return {
    ...chakraDefaultProps,
    ...DEFAULT_PROPS[type]?.form,
  }
}
```

Reason:

```text
Custom ForgeUI widgets do not exist inside Chakra.
Without optional chaining Studio crashes when the inspector opens.
```

---

# Step 6 — Add Default Props

File:

```text
studio/src/utils/defaultProps.tsx
```

Add:

```ts
Led: {},

Bar: {
  value: 70,
},

Arc: {
  value: 65,
},
```

Optional but recommended.

---

# Step 7 — Add Preview Renderer

File:

```text
studio/src/components/editor/ComponentPreview.tsx
```

Add:

```ts
case 'Led'
case 'Bar'
case 'Arc'
```

Provide simple visual previews.

Example:

```text
Led = green glowing circle

Bar = progress bar

Arc = circular ring
```

Goal:

```text
Visual representation only.
```

---

# Step 8 — Validate Browser Preview

Expected:

```text
Widget appears in toolbox

Widget drags onto canvas

Widget renders

Widget can be resized

Widget can be selected

Inspector opens

No runtime errors
```

Status:

```text
PROVEN
```

For:

```text
Led
Bar
Arc
```

---

# Step 9 — Add LVGL Export

File:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
```

Add export handlers.

Examples:

LED:

```c
lv_obj_t *led =
    lv_led_create(parent);

lv_obj_set_size(
    led,
    w,
    h
);

lv_obj_set_pos(
    led,
    x,
    y
);

lv_led_on(led);
```

BAR:

```c
lv_obj_t *bar =
    lv_bar_create(parent);

lv_obj_set_size(
    bar,
    w,
    h
);

lv_obj_set_pos(
    bar,
    x,
    y
);

lv_bar_set_value(
    bar,
    70,
    LV_ANIM_OFF
);
```

ARC:

```c
lv_obj_t *arc =
    lv_arc_create(parent);

lv_obj_set_size(
    arc,
    w,
    h
);

lv_obj_set_pos(
    arc,
    x,
    y
);
```

---

# Step 10 — Hardware Validation

Build:

```text
Clean Build & Flash
```

Validate:

```text
Studio
    ↓
Preview
    ↓
Export
    ↓
ESP32-P4
```

Expected:

```text
Widget renders on physical hardware.
```

---

FORGEUI_LVGL_WIDGET_LIBRARY_V1__FULL_REGISTRATION_PREVIEW_AND_CLEAN_SIDEBAR_PROVEN__EXPORT_NEXT__2026-06-14
```

## Status

```text
PROVEN
```

## What Was Achieved

```text
LVGL widget catalog added to ForgeUI Studio.
Custom non-Chakra widget path proven.
LVGL widgets can now appear in the toolbox.
LVGL widgets can now drag onto the canvas.
LVGL widgets can now render as browser preview placeholders.
ForgeUI sidebar cleaned so only ForgeUI Core widgets are visible.
Legacy OpenChakra clutter hidden from the normal toolbox view.
```

## Widgets Registered

```text
Led
Bar
Arc
Chart
Table
Keyboard
Calendar
Scale
Roller
Msgbox
ButtonMatrix
Canvas
Line
Tabview
Tileview
ImageButton
AnimImage
Lottie
Spinner
```

## Files Touched

```text
studio/src/types.d.ts
studio/src/componentsList.ts
studio/src/utils/editor.ts
studio/src/utils/defaultProps.tsx
studio/src/components/editor/ComponentPreview.tsx
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUIWidgetSet.ts
studio/src/components/sidebar/Menu.tsx
```

## Key Fixes

```text
ComponentType updated with LVGL widget names.

menuItems updated so LVGL widgets exist in toolbox registry.

componentsList updated so LVGL widgets are searchable/listable.

COMPONENTS/rootComponents updated so LVGL widgets are accepted by drag/drop.

getDefaultFormProps updated with Chakra[type]?.defaultProps || {} so custom ForgeUI/LVGL widgets do not crash the inspector.

ComponentPreview updated with real previews for Led, Bar, Arc.

ComponentPreview updated with placeholder previews for the wider LVGL widget set.

forgeuiCoreWidgets updated to put useful LVGL/HMI widgets at the top.

Sidebar Menu updated to show only forgeuiCoreWidgets, hiding inherited OpenChakra clutter.
```

## Proven Validation

```text
Led preview renders.
Bar preview renders.
Arc preview renders.
Chart placeholder renders.
Lottie placeholder renders.
Keyboard placeholder renders.

Widgets drag onto canvas.
Widgets select correctly.
Widgets resize correctly.
Sidebar now only shows ForgeUI Core / LVGL-focused widgets.
```

## Architecture Truth

```text
ForgeUI Studio is no longer only a Chakra/OpenChakra editor.

ForgeUI Studio can now host custom ForgeUI/LVGL widgets.

Current implementation provides browser-side registration and preview.

Next work is LVGL export generation for the new widgets.
```

## Next Mission

```text
FORGEUI_LVGL_WIDGET_EXPORT_V1__LED_BAR_ARC_FLASH_PROOF_NEXT
```

## Next Work

```text
Add LVGL export cases in:

studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts

Start with:

Led  -> lv_led_create
Bar  -> lv_bar_create
Arc  -> lv_arc_create

Then Clean Build & Flash to validate on physical ESP32-P4.
```

```
