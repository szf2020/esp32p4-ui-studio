---

## Asset Ownership Contract

### Browser Asset Source

```text
studio/public/assets/
```

Owns:

* PNG assets
* SVG assets
* Source artwork
* Source icon files

---

### Live Firmware Asset Target

```text
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/assets/
```

Owns:

* LVGL image assets
* Runtime icon assets
* Generated image source files

---

### Export Asset Target

```text
exports/<project>/main/assets/
```

Owns:

* Standalone export resources

---

### Hard Rule

Studio assets must never be compiled directly by ESP-IDF.

Required flow:

```text
studio/public/assets
    ↓
export bridge
    ↓
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/assets
    ↓
ESP-IDF build
```

---

## Forbidden Architecture Drift

Never use:

```text
studio/firmware/
```

Never create:

```text
studio/firmware/ForgeUI-One/
```

Treat these paths as architecture drift and accidental junk.

---

## Build & Flash Flow

```text
Canvas
    ↓
Generate LVGL
    ↓
Generate Asset List
    ↓
Write Runtime Files
    ↓
Copy Runtime Assets
    ↓

    ↓
ESP32-P4
```

---

## Generated Runtime Files

```text
90_Studio_Export.c
90_Studio_Export.h
```

Generated files are disposable build artifacts.

Never manually edit them.

All changes originate from the visual canvas.

---

# 5. Export Pipeline

## Detached Export CMake Parity Rule

The live Build & Flash path and the detached Export ESP-IDF Project path must generate the same core runtime source list.

### Correct Runtime Source List

Both `/export` and `/export-idf-project` must include:

```text
main.c
01_FG_Runtime.c
20_RTC.c
30_Audio.c
30_WIFI.c
40_SD.c
90_Studio_Export.c

## Export Status

**PROVEN**

The standalone ESP-IDF export path is operational.

---

## Export Route

```text
POST /export-idf-project

Reason

Studio Build & Flash works because it builds inside:

firmware/ForgeUI-One/

Detached export builds inside:

C:\ForgeUI-Exports\<project>\

If /export-idf-project only generates:

main.c
90_Studio_Export.c

the project will configure and build the bootloader, but fail at final link with errors such as:

undefined reference to fg_runtime_init
undefined reference to fg_rtc_init
undefined reference to fg_wifi_init
undefined reference to fg_sd_init
undefined reference to fg_wifi_pump
undefined reference to fg_sd_test
Hard Rule

Never update the live /export CMake generation without checking the detached /export-idf-project CMake generation.

They must stay aligned unless there is a deliberate, documented reason.

Current Fix

In:

studio/export-server.js

inside:

app.post('/export-idf-project')

the cmakeSources block must match the live export route:

const cmakeSources = [
  '"main.c"',
  '"01_FG_Runtime.c"',
  '"20_RTC.c"',
  '"30_Audio.c"',
  '"30_WIFI.c"',
  '"40_SD.c"',
  '"90_Studio_Export.c"',
]

Asset sources are appended after this:

assetSources.forEach((src) => {
  cmakeSources.push(`"${src}"`)
})
```

---

## Export Protection

Enabled:

* Auto increment export folders
* Collision protection
* Overwrite prevention

Example:

```text
ForgeUI_Export
ForgeUI_Export_001
ForgeUI_Export_002
ForgeUI_Export_003
```

---

## Export Cleanliness Rules

Never export:

```text
build/
.vscode/
.vs/
managed_components/
```

Purpose:

* smaller exports
* clean rebuilds
* portable projects

---

# 6. Browser Preview System

## Status

PROVEN

Browser Preview is operational and validated.

---

## Components

```text
studio/src/forgeui/preview/
```

Contains:

* DevicePreview.tsx
* forgePreviewRenderer.tsx
* forgeThemeMap.ts

---

## Browser Preview Rule

Browser Preview is a simulation.

Physical hardware remains the source of truth.

---

# 7. Theme System

## Shared Token Contract

```json
{
  "tokens": [
    "bg",
    "surface",
    "surface2",
    "border",
    "text",
    "accent"
  ]
}
```

---

## Current Theme Library

* Matrix Green
* Reactor Dark
* Graphite
* Nordic Blue
* Military Green
* Cyber Teal
* Forge Orange
* Nebula Purple
* OLED Black
* Carbon Red
* Arctic Ice
* Industrial Steel
* Lava Core
* Blueprint
* Toxic Lime

---

# 8. Widget Export Matrix

## Hardware Validated

### Controls

* Button
* Slider
* Switch
* Checkbox
* Radio

### Text

* Label
* Input
* Textarea
* NumberInput

### Layout

* Box
* Select

### Status

* Progress
* CircularProgress

### Images

* Image placeholder path operational
* Asset pipeline under active development

---

# 9. Asset Pipeline Status

## Current State

Detached standalone export now builds and flashes independently from C:\ForgeUI-Exports\<project>\ with copied assets and restored CMake parity.
Proven:

* Asset discovery operational
* Asset transport operational
* Asset-aware export operational
* Asset-aware Build & Flash operational
* Asset-aware CMake generation operational

---

## Proven Data Flow

```text
ForgeUIAssetRegistry
        ↓
FORGEUI_IMAGE_ASSETS
        ↓
asset.cFile
        ↓
generateForgeUILvglCode()
        ↓
assetSources[]
        ↓
Header.tsx
        ↓
/export
        ↓
Generated CMakeLists.txt
        ↓
idf_component_register(SRCS ...)
```

---

## Proven Progress

Old failure:

```text
undefined reference to fg_icon_add_users_48px
```

Advanced to:

```text
Cannot find source file:
main/assets/icons/fg_icon_add_users_48px.c
```

This proves:

* asset discovery works
* asset transport works
* export route works
* generated CMake works
* ESP-IDF sees expected asset references

---

## Current Blocker

Physical icon asset copy not yet complete.

Required target:

```text
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/assets/icons/
```

---

## Next Proof Required

Build log should show:

```text
fg_icon_add_users_48px.c.obj
```

instead of:

```text
Cannot find source file
```

---

## Next Mission

Trace:

```text
ForgeUIAssetRegistry
    ↓
FORGEUI_IMAGE_ASSETS
    ↓
asset.cFile
    ↓
/export route
    ↓
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/assets/icons/
```

Implement physical icon copy.

Then validate:

* Build success
* Flash success
* Icon render on physical ESP32-P4

---

# 10. Immediate Roadmap

## Near-Term

* Complete icon asset copy
* Physical icon rendering
* Improve Button actions
* Improve Switch actions
* Improve Slider bindings
* Improve Progress bindings
* Improve Radio support
* Improve Checkbox support

---

## Mid-Term

* Theme editor
* Surface editor
* Background flavour editor
* Component styling tools
* Asset manager
* Property panel improvements

---

## Long-Term

* Full LVGL export coverage
* Professional HMI workflow
* Commercial-grade ESP32-P4 designer
* Standalone packaged desktop application
* Production deployment pipeline
* Community component ecosystem

---

# Source Of Truth Rule

The Spine is the architecture authority.

If code, documentation, exports, or discussions disagree:

**The Spine wins.**
