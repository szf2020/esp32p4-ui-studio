# Current Architecture Truth

```text
The image conversion problem is solved.

The image integration problem is solved.

The uploaded image pipeline is complete.

The theme selection problem is solved.

The theme ownership problem is solved.

Theme Manager is now the single source of truth for theme selection.

Uploaded image assets now complete a full end-to-end path from ForgeUI Studio to physical ESP32-P4 hardware.

Theme selection now completes a full end-to-end path from ForgeUI Studio to physical ESP32-P4 hardware.

Remaining work is refinement, presentation quality, texture systems, scaling controls, asset management improvements, and multi-image validation.
