# Theme Drift Elimination (2026-06-13)

## Status

PROVEN

---

## Root Cause

ForgeUI contained two separate theme systems:

### Browser Theme System

```text
FG_PREVIEW_PALETTES
```

Used by:

```text
Theme Manager
ForgeThemeContext
Builder
Browser Preview
```

### Export Theme System

```text
FG_PALETTES
```

Used by:

```text
ForgeUILvglExport.ts
Generated LVGL Code
ESP32-P4
```

The systems drifted apart.

Example:

```text
Nordic Ice rendered correctly in Browser Preview
Nordic Ice exported as Reactor Dark
ESP32-P4 flashed incorrect dark background
```

---

## Architecture Change

Removed:

```text
FG_PALETTES
```

Removed all duplicate palette definitions from:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
```

Export now imports:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/preview/forgeThemeMap.ts
```

and consumes:

```text
FG_PREVIEW_PALETTES
```

directly.

---

## Current Theme Architecture

```text
FG_PREVIEW_PALETTES
        ↓
Theme Manager
        ↓
ForgeThemeContext
        ↓
Builder
        ↓
Browser Preview
        ↓
ForgeUILvglExport
        ↓
Generated LVGL C
        ↓
ESP32-P4
```

Single source of truth.

---

## Validation

Nordic Ice

```text
Preview = Correct
ESP32-P4 = Correct
```

Graphite

```text
Preview = Correct
ESP32-P4 = Correct
Carbon texture exported correctly
```

Test Purple

```text
Added to FG_PREVIEW_PALETTES only

Automatically appeared in Theme Manager
Automatically appeared in Browser Preview
Automatically exported through LVGL
Automatically flashed on ESP32-P4
```

Result:

```text
Theme drift eliminated.
Single-source theme architecture proven.
```
---

# Current Architecture Truth

```text
The image conversion problem is solved.

The image integration problem is solved.

The uploaded image pipeline is complete.

The theme selection problem is solved.

The theme ownership problem is solved.

Theme Manager is now the single source of truth for theme selection.

Uploaded image assets now complete a full end-to-end path from ForgeUI Studio to physical ESP32-P4 hardware.

Theme selection now completes a full end-to-end path from ForgeUI Studio to physical ESP32-P4 hardware.

Remaining work is refinement, presentation quality, texture systems, scaling controls, asset management improvements, and multi-image validation.

# New Proven Milestones

✓ AI / Sci-Fi theme pack imported

✓ 1024x600 PNG hero backgrounds added to Studio public textures

✓ 1024x600 PNG hero backgrounds converted to LVGL C assets

✓ Generated C assets registered in ForgeUILvglExport.ts

✓ Builder renders AI hero backgrounds

✓ Browser Preview renders AI hero backgrounds

✓ CSS URL spacing issue fixed with quoted backgroundImage URLs

✓ LVGL export supports textureMode tile/fullscreen

✓ Industrial textures continue using tiled rendering

✓ AI hero backgrounds render once at 0,0 fullscreen

✓ Build & Flash successful

✓ Physical ESP32-P4 renders fullscreen AI hero background

✓ Theme Manager → Preview → Export → P4 path proven

Validated on hardware:

AI Nexus / Neural-style 1024x600 hero background rendered fullscreen on ESP32-P4.
Widgets rendered above background.
Old side-by-side tiling issue fixed.

Architecture rule remains:

FG_PREVIEW_PALETTES remains the single source of truth.
No FG_PALETTES.
No duplicate theme system.
ForgeUILvglExport.ts consumes forgeThemeMap.ts.

# ForgeUI Feature Map — Where Things Live

This section exists so future chats do not need 10 file tabs pasted every time.

---

## Main Lanes

```text
Browser / Editor Lane
    ↓
Studio UI, Builder, Theme Manager, Asset Manager, Preview
```

Lives mostly in:

```text
studio/src/components/
studio/src/forgeui/
studio/src/forgeui/preview/
studio/src/forgeui/theme/
```

---

```text
Export Lane
    ↓
Turns Studio layout into LVGL C
```

Main file:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
```

If something works in browser but not on the ESP32-P4, check this lane first.

---

```text
Firmware Lane
    ↓
ESP-IDF / LVGL project that builds and flashes
```

Lives in:

```text
firmware/ForgeUI-One/
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/assets/
```

If the build fails or an asset does not compile, check this lane.

---

# Feature Touch Map

## Add / edit themes

Touch:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/preview/forgeThemeMap.ts
```

Do not start by touching firmware.

---

## Add background textures

Touch:

```text
studio/public/textures/
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/assets/themes/
studio/src/forgeui/preview/forgeThemeMap.ts
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
```

Known proven example:

```text
carbon_fiber.png
fg_theme_carbon_fiber.c
fg_theme_carbon_fiber
```

---

## Add Background Selector / Randomiser

Likely touch:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/theme/ForgeThemeContext.tsx
Theme Manager component
studio/src/forgeui/preview/forgeThemeMap.ts
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
```

Rule:

```text
Theme Manager owns the UI.
ForgeThemeContext owns selected state.
forgeThemeMap owns preview theme/background metadata.
ForgeUILvglExport owns physical ESP32-P4 output.
```

Do not create another theme selector.

---

## Add uploaded image features

Touch:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/assets/ForgeUIAssetManager.tsx
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUIUploadedAssetRegistry.ts
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
tools/lvgl/LVGLImage.py
firmware/ForgeUI-One/main/assets/uploads/
```

---

## Add new widgets

Touch:

```text
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUIWidgetSet.ts
studio/src/components/editor/ComponentPreview.tsx
studio/src/forgeui/ForgeUILvglExport.ts
```

Rule:

```text
Browser widget first.
LVGL export second.
P4 flash third.
```

---

# Current Texture System Direction

Do not re-research image conversion.

Current next work:

```text
Texture Pack V1
Background Playground
Background Selector
Randomiser
Flash Flair
```

Preferred order:

```text
1. Add more built-in texture PNGs
2. Convert them to LVGL C assets
3. Add texture entries to forgeThemeMap.ts
4. Add textureAsset entries to ForgeUILvglExport.ts
5. Validate Browser Preview
6. Clean Build & Flash
7. Validate physical ESP32-P4
8. Then expose selector/randomiser in Theme Manager
```

---

# Rule For Future Chats

Before asking Scott to paste files, first identify the lane:

```text
Browser problem?
Export problem?
Firmware problem?
Asset conversion problem?
```

Then ask only for the smallest file set from that lane.


# Future One-Wrapper Goal

Current setup:

```text
pip install pypng lz4
```

Future setup:

```text
START_FORGEUI_STUDIO.bat
    ↓
Check Node
    ↓
Check npm
    ↓
Check Python
    ↓
Check pypng
    ↓
Check lz4
    ↓
Install Missing Dependencies
    ↓
Start Export Server
    ↓
Start Studio Frontend
    ↓
Open Browser
```

Goal:

```text
User installs Node.js

User installs ESP-IDF

Everything else is handled by ForgeUI Studio.
```

# Source Of Truth

Current architecture truth:

```text
Asset Manager = Proven

Uploaded Image Pipeline = Proven

Theme Manager = Proven

Theme Export = Proven

Browser Preview = Proven

Build & Flash = Proven

Clean Build & Flash = Proven

Detached Export = Proven

LVGLImage.py = Proven

PNG → LVGL C = Proven

Generated Asset Compilation = Proven

Physical ESP32-P4 Rendering = Proven

Remaining Work:

Texture System V1

Image sizing parity

Multi-image validation

Asset cleanup

Asset management improvements

Custom Theme Creation

Theme Categories

Presentation quality improvements
```

Future chats should treat this as the active architecture truth.
