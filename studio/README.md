# ESP32-P4 UI Studio | Visual LVGL Creator & Embedded Deployment Toolchain 🚀

**ESP32-P4 UI Studio** is an open-source, all-in-one visual HMI designer and automated deployment toolchain engineered specifically for **ESP32-P4** touchscreen hardware running **LVGL v9**. 

By adapting a mature drag-and-drop editor engine toward a hardware-aware embedded layout workflow platform, this project completely bridges web-based visual prototyping with automated native hardware flashing. The project aims to reduce the traditional complexity of embedded LVGL workflows by integrating visual editing, export generation, and firmware deployment into a single coordinated workspace.

## ⚡ Major Milestone: End-to-End Hardware Pipeline

The project is developing an integrated hardware workflow in local dev mode. It moves from design toward physical execution:

```text
Visual Editor ➔ LVGL C Export ➔ Local Export Bridge ➔ ESP-IDF Firmware Runtime ➔ ESP32-P4 Flash ➔ Live Hardware Rendering
```

This pipeline has been validated for the core dev flow and remains under active refinement.

* Theme packs and texture systems now emerging as a major ForgeUI Studio feature direction.

## 🛠️ Hardware Target & Tech Stack

Out of the box, the workspace environment is pre-tuned for high-speed performance on industrial-grade layouts:
* **Primary Target Hardware:** Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-7B
* **Viewport Metrics:** 1024x600 fixed pixel resolution
* **Graphics Library:** LVGL v9 
* **Backend Framework:** ESP-IDF v5.5.4

## 📦 Project Architecture & Directory Layout

The workspace functions as a clean, self-contained monorepo split cleanly into two independent engines:

```text
esp32p4-ui-studio/
├── studio/                 # Visual Editor & UI Design Workspace (React / Next.js)
├── firmware/
│   └── ForgeUI-One/        # Pure ESP-IDF Runtime, BSP, and LVGL Application Shell
├── tools/                  # Automated build, compilation, and flashing utilities
├── START_FORGEUI_STUDIO.bat # Legacy visible launcher
├── START_FORGEUI_STUDIO_HIDDEN.vbs # Current hidden dev launcher
├── STOP_FORGEUI_STUDIO.bat # Current runtime shutdown helper
├── README.md               # Workspace documentation
├── LICENSE                 # Core open-source license agreements
└── 01_SPINE.md             # Architecture spine index
```

### The Architectural Separation of Concerns
1. **The Studio Side (`/studio`)**: Owns the visual editor workspace, canvas viewport bounds clamping, absolute x/y layout state, property inspectors, and LVGL C code generation orchestration.
2. **The Firmware Side (`/firmware`)**: Owns the native ESP-IDF compilation workspace, Board Support Package (BSP) setup, display/touch peripheral drivers, and the live application shell. Generated UI files are cleanly injected as isolated build artifacts.

## 🚨 Crucial Architectural Rules

To maintain high stability and maintainability, the project strictly enforces these design separation protocols:
* **Do NOT** embed React or web runtimes into the embedded firmware.
* **Do NOT** turn the ESP-IDF hardware layer into a web runtime wrapper.
* **Do NOT** tightly couple active frontend Chakra UI preview components into the structural LVGL code exporter logic.
* **The Paradigm:** Studio generates static LVGL artifacts ➔ Firmware compiles and executes LVGL artifacts ➔ Hardware renders the live interface.

## 🎨 Current Feature Matrix & Widget Coverage

### Structural & Core Features
* Fixed-viewport layout editing with absolute coordinate positioning
* Persistent wrapper-owned interaction mechanics (movement, resizing, selection)
* Browser Preview V1 with Preview-to-P4 validation workflow
* Shared theme pipeline across:
  - Studio Canvas
  - Browser Preview
  - LVGL Export
  - ESP32-P4 Hardware
* Automated local Node.js export bridge runs in the background while the studio operates as a local dev server.
* Desktop wrapper via Wails/Tauri/Electron is deferred and not currently packaged.
* Automated ESP-IDF build and flash orchestration
* Real ESP32-P4 hardware flash validation pipeline proven

### Preview-to-P4 Widget Parity V1

The following widgets are now visually mapped through:

Studio → Browser Preview → LVGL Export → ESP32-P4 Hardware

* Text
* Button
* Input
* Textarea
* Switch
* Checkbox
* Radio
* Slider
* Progress
* CircularProgress
* NumberInput
* Select
* Box
* Image *(placeholder-level currently)*

### Theme System V1

ForgeUI Studio now includes a shared theme contract system powering:

* Browser Preview
* Generated LVGL
* ESP32-P4 hardware runtime

#### Shared Theme Tokens

* bg
* surface
* surface2
* border
* text
* accent

#### Proven Theme Packs

* Reactor Dark
* Graphite
* Nordic Blue
* Military Green
* Cyber Teal
* Forge Orange
* Nebula Purple
* OLED Black
* Matrix Green
* Carbon Red
* Arctic Ice
* Industrial Steel
* Lava Core
* Blueprint
* Toxic Lime

### Current Export Notes

* Browser Preview remains an approximation layer only.
* Final ESP32-P4 hardware render remains the source of truth.
* Several widgets are already interactive on hardware.
* Image export currently remains placeholder-level.
* Theme spacing, glow, and sizing parity continue improving between browser and hardware.

## 🔄 Live Developer Workflow

1. Run the current dev launcher:
   ```bash
   START_FORGEUI_STUDIO_HIDDEN.vbs
   ```
2. The local dev server starts, the export bridge runs in the background, and the browser interface is available at `localhost:3000`.
3. Visually construct your interface on the workspace canvas using absolute coordinates.
4. Click **Export UI to Device** (*"Export UI to Device"*).
5. The pipeline writes out your clean `90_Studio_Export.c` / `.h` assets, invokes the ESP-IDF compiler backend, and can build/flash the target board. LVGL export coverage is still under active development.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Current Roadmap

### Active Constraints
* Local script paths are currently pre-configured for Windows host environments.
* LVGL styling capabilities (fonts, custom radiuses, explicit hex color mapping) are currently undergoing normalization.
* Live workspace logs require ongoing terminal visibility for end users.

### Strategic Priorities
* Rename UI actions to explicit targets (e.g., `Export UI to Device` and `Full Clean + Flash Device`).
* Expand code generation coverage across additional native LVGL widgets and layouts.
* Add automated desktop application wrapper packages for zero-config onboarding.
* Introduce native hardware state/connection telemetry feedback monitors into the web inspector toolbar.

## 📜 Upstream Attribution & Open Source Licensing

**ESP32-P4 UI Studio** builds on an upstream MIT-licensed editor engine originally developed by Premier Octet. This fork expands, refactors, and pivots that engine specifically toward low-level embedded software workflows, coordinate-based screen mapping, and ESP32 execution toolchains. 

The original MIT open-source license and author attributions remain fully preserved inside this repository. For explicit dependency details, please review `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`.
