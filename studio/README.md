**ESP32-P4 Studio** (ForgeUI Studio) is an open-source, low-code visual HMI designer and automated deployment toolchain built for **Espressif ESP32-P4** microcontrollers running **LVGL v9**.

This platform bridges web-based drag-and-drop UI prototyping with low-level embedded hardware deployment. It transforms absolute visual layouts directly into optimized native C code, automates the ESP-IDF compilation pipeline, and flashes production-ready firmware to your touch screen development board in a single click.

## ⚡ Key Features & Embedded Toolchain Pipeline

Eliminate manual UI positioning and slow compilation loops. ESP32-P4 Studio automates the entire embedded graphics workflow locally:

```text
Visual Drag-and-Drop ➔ LVGL v9 C Code Gen ➔ Local Node.js Bridge ➔ ESP-IDF Compiler ➔ Direct USB Flashing ➔ Live LCD Rendering
```

* **Direct Hardware Flashing:** Flash compiled UI binaries straight to the ESP32 chip using built-in scripting utilities.
* **WYSIWYG HMI Creator:** Visual canvas configured for high-performance industrial layouts and responsive tactile testing.
* **Shared Theme Engine:** Synchronized color profiles across the browser design workspace, interactive previews, and physical LCD panels.


## 🚀 Standalone ESP-IDF Export Pipeline V1

ForgeUI Studio now supports exporting fully standalone ESP-IDF firmware projects directly from the visual editor environment.

This means generated projects can:
* build independently from ForgeUI Studio
* open directly in Visual Studio Code
* rebuild from a clean state
* flash independently to ESP32-P4 hardware
* function as portable/shareable embedded firmware projects

### Proven Export Validation Flow

### Export Architecture Separation

ForgeUI Studio intentionally separates:
* visual editor logic
* browser preview rendering
* export orchestration

from:
* BSP ownership
* LVGL runtime lifecycle
* ESP-IDF infrastructure
* display/touch/audio runtime systems

Generated projects inject only:

```text
90_Studio_Export.c
90_Studio_Export.h
```

into the ForgeUI-One runtime shell.

This architecture keeps exports:
* lightweight
* reproducible
* portable
* hardware-focused
* rebuild-safe

## 📦 Project Architecture & Directory Structure

The repository is built as a self-contained monorepo separating the web workspace from the native firmware application shell:

```

### Architectural Separation of Concerns
1. **The Studio App (`/studio`)**: Manages absolute X/Y coordinates, custom component state, layout nesting, and automated asset generation exports.
2. **The Firmware Layer (`/firmware`)**: Runs bare-metal C configurations, hardware peripheral drivers, display/touch screen controllers, and integrates output files as isolated build artifacts.

---

## 🚨 Architectural Constraints & Design Rules

To ensure performance stability on resource-constrained microcontrollers, the project enforces structural separation:
* **No Web Runtimes on Chip:** HTML/CSS, React, or browser wrappers do not run on the ESP32-P4 processor.
* **Pure Static Output:** The React editor compiles layouts down to pure, hardware-native static LVGL C artifacts (`.c` / `.h`).
* **Zero Component Coupling:** Frontend React components (Chakra UI) remain completely isolated from the static code exporter scripts.

---

## 🎨 Supported LVGL Widgets & Theme Packs

### Preview-to-Hardware Widget Parity Matrix
The following UI controls map directly from the **Design Workspace ➔ Browser Preview ➔ Transpiled C Code ➔ Live ESP32-P4 LCD Screen**:

* **Basic Controls:** Text, Button, Box, Image (Placeholder)
* **Input Elements:** Input fields, Textarea blocks, NumberInput fields, Select drop-downs
* **Toggles & Selectors:** Switch, Checkbox, Radio buttons, Sliders
* **Status Monitors:** Progress Bars, Circular Progress loops

### Built-in Color Themes
The project includes 15 ready-to-use aesthetic UI palettes sharing common tokens (`bg`, `surface`, `border`, `text`, `accent`):

* *Matrix Green (Default)*, Reactor Dark, Graphite, Nordic Blue, Military Green, Cyber Teal, Forge Orange, Nebula Purple, OLED Black, Carbon Red, Arctic Ice, Industrial Steel, Lava Core, Blueprint, and Toxic Lime.

## 🔄 Live Developer Workflow Guide

Follow these steps to build and flash a user interface to your ESP32-P4 controller:

1. **Initialize the Local Server:** Run the background utility script:
   ```bash
   START_FORGEUI_STUDIO_HIDDEN.vbs
   ```
2. **Access the Interface:** Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
3. **Design Your HMI:** Drag, drop, scale, and position your interactive layout components inside the 1024x600 layout grid.
4. **Compile & Deploy UI:** Click **Build & Flash** or **Clean Build & Flash** in the top navigation panel.
5. **Hardware Execution:** The local Node.js export bridge exports `90_Studio_Export.c` / `.h` assets, invokes the ESP-IDF backend compiler, and uploads the firmware binary directly over your USB-C interface.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Project Roadmap

### Ongoing Developments
* **Cross-Platform Scripts:** Current automation paths (`.bat` / `.vbs`) are built for Windows; Linux and macOS support profiles are in progress.
* **Font & Styling Normalization:** Upgrading deep styling parameters, custom corner radiuses, and explicit HEX color overrides.
* **Telemetry Interfaces:** Integrating real-time hardware status logs and connection monitors directly into the web layout inspector toolbar.
